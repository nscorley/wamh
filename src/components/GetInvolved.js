        <p>
          But first, if you love music or news and would like to get involved without doing a show,
          we have opportunities to write about music and organize events/concerts.
          Additionally, if you are looking for administrative experience, would
          like exposure to budgeting, or the inner workings of media/communications
          contact one of our E-board members about potential open positions.
          Moreover, WAMH will be performing workshops and tours in conjunction
          with NEPR, stay tuned for more information about upcoming programming.
          As always â€“ feel free to stop by during business hours or get in touch
          with any of our board members for more information on how you can get
          involved with WAMH Radio.

              Come see us to schedule a DJ training! We will hold several scheduled
              training sessions at the beginning of each semester, but we can also
              schedule them by appointment. At your training session you will get
              the low-down on how to work the cool WAMH equipment.

          <Tab eventKey={2} title={<span><Glyphicon glyph="pencil" /><h5>Pass Our Exam </h5></span>}>
            <p>
              After your training you can either immediately take your DJ test or schedule
              it for another time. The DJ test is a 5-10 minute quiz about your training
              session and the contents of the WAMH DJ Manual. Click the hyper link
              to access a copy of the DJ manual.

            <p>
            Sit in on a show with a current DJ to get the feel of what goes on at the studio.
            They will help show you the ropes, provide some helfpul tips and tricks,
            and give you a better idea what to expect.
