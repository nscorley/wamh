    image: JOSH_PHOTO,
    bio: "Mr. Brainin became passionate about music festivals and concerts at a young age, attending his first Lollapalooza at 13 years old. From there Mr. Brainin's love for concerts and music festivals only expanded, as he became an avid goer of the live Chicago music scene. Soon after Brainin got his first taste of the music business at 15 years old by helping to sell concert tickets for up and coming local artist at the time, Chance the Rapper. Seeing other young creatives be successful and innovative in the industry reaffirmed Brainin's confidence that pursuing a career path in the entertainment industry was worth the risk. In 2016, Brainin, alongside fellow collaborators formed Shinobi Cabal, which served as an artistic collective, primarily music, and performed at major venues all across the city. Brainin handled managing the artists, booking, and promoting the shows. Brainin later began to work at the historic venue, Metro Chicago, where he worked closely with the talent buyer and gained more insight on the industry. Brainin eventually left the collective as he became dissatisfied with following the basic template for promoting shows and had visions toward creating something innovative within the entertainment industry. Brainin began to create new concepts for how events could be experienced that involved immersing and engaging ones senses and began to experiment with ideas at Amherst College, where he has been the event coordinator for the past two years. Brainin studies Film and Media at Amherst as well as designs clothing and is passionate about creating in all mediums as well as fusing them together to create new platforms. Brainin also has a deep interest in the human experience and is developing ways to create experiences that allow us to explore our individual and collective experience more deeply. Brainin's love for technology, art, innovation, and transcendental experiences brought him to Amherst College to further pursue and develop his craft.",
